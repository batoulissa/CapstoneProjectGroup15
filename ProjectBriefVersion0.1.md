#**1. Project Overview
Summary

Possible Names: TheraTalk, WellTalk, TheraWell, MindEase, MindConnect
TheraTalk: A mental health therapy app connecting users with certified therapists through secure, flexible communication options.
Purpose: To provide accessible and personalized mental health support through AI-driven therapist matching and user-friendly interfaces.
Core Features: Secure messaging and video sessions, and anonymous interactions.

**2. Service Flow
User Journey
User Sign-Up: Users create an account, set up a profile, and specify their mental health needs and preferences. Questionnaire/Test to determine mental health help needed. 
Dashboard: users can write their problem anonymously and experts can help with sessions or comments. 
Therapist Matching: AI algorithm matches users with suitable therapists based on their profile and preferences. Ability to choose a therapist/psychiatrist. 
Session Booking: Users book therapy sessions or start a text-based conversation with their matched therapist.
In-Session: Users engage in secure, encrypted text or video sessions with their therapist.
Post-Session Feedback: Users rate the session and leave feedback, which contributes to therapist reviews. Review system for the experts. 

Future possible features: Daily Challenges: Users receive daily wellness challenges and affirmations, earning points for completion.
**Roadmap
Phase 1: Research & Planning
Conduct market research, define target personas, and outline features.
Set up the project structure, including GitHub repository and task management tools.
Phase 2: Design & Prototyping, UML design
Create wireframes, mockups, and user interface designs.
Develop a functional prototype to test core features with a small group of users.
Phase 3: Development
Build the front-end and back-end of the application.
Integrate AI models, APIs, and security features.
Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
Conduct user testing, fix bugs, and optimize performance.
Implement feedback from testing to refine the app.
Phase 5: Launch & Marketing
Deploy the app to app stores and launch marketing campaigns.
Monitor user feedback and roll out updates.
**3. Personas
Target Customers
All Backgrounds: all individuals seeking accessible mental health support.
Working Professionals: People with demanding jobs who need flexible, remote mental health care.
Students: College and university students dealing with academic stress and mental health challenges. 
**4. Pain Points & Challenges
Pain Points
User Trust & Privacy: Ensuring users feel safe and their data is protected requires robust encryption and data protection protocols. Anonymous feature. 
Therapist Verification: Verifying therapist credentials to maintain trust in the platform can be time-consuming and costly. 
AI Accuracy: Ensuring the AI correctly matches users with therapists based on their needs requires continuous optimization and testing.
Challenges & Costs
Development Time: Building and integrating AI models, secure communication channels, and other features will be time-intensive.
Compliance: Ensuring the app meets legal requirements, South Koreaâ€™s data protection laws, such as the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).
Scalability: Designing the app to handle potentially high user volumes and data loads will require careful planning and resources.
Korean Psychological Association (KPA): The KPA oversees the certification of psychologists in South Korea. Therapists who are registered with the KPA have met the necessary educational and training requirements. Verification Process: You can partner with the KPA to verify the credentials of psychologists. This might involve accessing their database to cross-check the qualifications of therapists who sign up on your platform.
National Health Insurance Service (NHIS): The NHIS can provide data on licensed practitioners within the country. Verification Process: You may be able to verify a therapist's registration and credentials through the NHIS database.

**5. Technologies Needed
