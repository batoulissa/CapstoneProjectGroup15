# Personas

**Target Customers:**
- **All Backgrounds:** Individuals seeking accessible mental health support.
- **Working Professionals:** People with demanding jobs who need flexible, remote mental health care.
- **Students:** College and university students dealing with academic stress and mental health challenges.

# Pain Points & Challenges

**Pain Points:**
- **User Trust & Privacy:** Ensuring users feel safe and their data is protected requires robust encryption and data protection protocols, including the anonymous feature.
- **Therapist Verification:** Verifying therapist credentials to maintain trust in the platform can be time-consuming and costly.
- **AI Accuracy:** Ensuring the AI correctly matches users with therapists based on their needs requires continuous optimization and testing.

**Challenges & Costs:**
- **Development Time:** Building and integrating AI models, secure communication channels, and other features will be time-intensive.
- **Compliance:** Ensuring the app meets legal requirements, such as South Koreaâ€™s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA).
- **Scalability:** Designing the app to handle potentially high user volumes and data loads will require careful planning and resources.

**Verification Partners:**
- **Korean Psychological Association (KPA):** Oversees the certification of psychologists in South Korea. Partner with KPA to verify therapist credentials through their database.
- **National Health Insurance Service (NHIS):** Provides data on licensed practitioners. Verify therapist registration and credentials through the NHIS database.
